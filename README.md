Learning about machine learning through implementation.
---

`decepticon` captures my learnings about ML through implementing and
experimenting in Rust. This is loosely following a couple of blog posts I've
found on implementing a simple feed forward network from scratch.

Goals
---
My primary goal is to learn about data science. It's something I wrote off
for a while, but now that I'm outside of academia I feel like I can learn it
more practically for fun. Some other things of interest:
 - Do some math - I haven't written out math on paper in a while, and I'm
 interested in the math behind machine learning.
 - Experiment - see if I can build a thing that seems to "learn".
 - Play with Rust - I've written a little bit here and there, but haven't
 kept up with the language lately, and I'd like to get back into learning
 Rust best practices and design patterns.
